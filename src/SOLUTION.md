Hello, this is my solution for the problem.

I've used the Jason Taylor template: https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture for me is one of the most complete ones I've seen so far, maybe the sample is groing to much... I rememeber the first versions, where there was no front-end, after press F5, you were redirected to the swagger page.

To run the project, hit F5, then select "API" in the menu (top right) and feel free to use the TASKS group.

I've added 2 tests to the CreateTaskCommand.

And that's it.
